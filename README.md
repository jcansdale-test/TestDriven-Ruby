## Quick Start

1. Browse to https://online.visualstudio.com and authenticate

2. Create a new environment with `jcansdale/TestDriven-Ruby` as the `Git Repository`

3. Load the new environment and open `targets.rb`

4. Right-click inside any Ruby method and `Debug Method`

There's a possible issue that might happen the first time the environment loads. You'll notice a `Couldn't find symbols` warning when you attempt to debug a method and no symbol names appear under `targets.rb`. If this happens, simply hit refresh on your browser and it _should_ sort itself out.

## About

When this repository is loaded by VS Online, it will install the Ruby and TestDriven extensions using a [devcontainer](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json).

- Ruby for VS Code by Peng Lv
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rebornix.Ruby

- TestDriven for VS Code by Jamie Cansdale
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JamieCansdale.testdriven

In order to work, TestDriven requires an active Ruby language server. This can done by enabeling the `"ruby.useLanguageServer": true` setting of the Ruby extnesion or by installing [Ruby Solargraph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castwide.solargraph). For simplicity and speed of loading I've enabled the `"ruby.useLanguageServer": true` setting in [devcontainer.json](https://github.com/jcansdale/TestDriven-Ruby/blob/dc8b1e7df0b8b090e7097ce4921e3cf64a2e0057/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json#L11).
