# Quick Start

1. Browse to https://online.visualstudio.com and authenticate

2. Create a new environment with `jcansdale/ruby-test` as the `Git Repository`

3. Load the new environment name and open `targets.rb`

5. Right-click inside any Ruby method and `Debug Method`

There's a possible issue that might happen the first time the environment loads. You'll notice a `Couldn't find symbols` warning when you attempt to debug a method and no symbol names appear under `targets.rb`. If this happens, simply hit refresh on your browser and it _should_ sort itself out.
